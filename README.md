# stratagem
my a-level project


Please run each level individually as navigation between levels is still yet to be implemented along with chat feature.
Level 1- level1.py
Level 2- maze.py
Level 3- level3.py
Level 4- level4.py

For the maze level (level 2) 2 players required.
Server file must be run first before initializing maze client. 
Server file takes IP dynamically (better to use personal hotspot as no firewalls)
Network file contains IP address, change IP address in network file and then send to other player along with maze file

Level 4 is successful only when the correct answer is shown as the input window dissapears, will add a note soon to congratulate user.
